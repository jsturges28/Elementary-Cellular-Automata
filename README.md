# Elementary-Cellular-Automata
Imagine a row with black and white squares (false and true), called cells, represented by 1 of 2 characters. Each of these characters are arranged in a 1D grid, and each cell can only be in 1 of 2 states. Now, suppose we can generate a new row of cells depending on certain factors, called a rule. The rule that determines the next state of a cell depends on the cellâ€™s current state and the states of its two nearest neighbors. In all, there are 256 different rules. Each new row generated is called a generation. When we generate enough rows, we get a pattern. Sometimes these patterns can be chaotic, or fractal, or random, depending on the rule. The program accepts a file to create an ECA. The first line indicates the rule number, the second indicates the false and true characters, and the third line represents the first row of the automaton. The 0s and 1s on this row uniquely specify the rule. The Wolfram Code interprets these bits as the binary number. Then, it converts the value of this number in base 10 to get the rule number.
